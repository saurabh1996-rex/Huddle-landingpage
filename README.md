## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I've implemented animate on scroll functionality inorder make the pages even interactive in nature and catches user attention quickly.Also focused on both flexbox and grid.


### Continued development

Really looking forward in working with much more complex CSS styles. I will be working on understanding flexbox and grid concepts in detail so that it'd be easier for me as I move along.


### Useful resources

- [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This has been my first line of contact when I was stuck at stages. It usually solved all my quests.
